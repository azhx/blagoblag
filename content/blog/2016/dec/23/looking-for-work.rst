Looking for work
================

For the past 2 years I've been working for the US Government at the United
States Digital Service. It's been a privilege, and I'm incredibly proud of the
things we've accomplished. Alas, all good things come to an end, and I'm now
looking for my next job.

I'm a software engineer, and I've worked on many different things. In my career
I've worked on just-in-time compilers for dynamic languages, large scale web
applications, and cryptography, to name a few. The thing I would like to do
next is help make the largest positive impact I can on **information security**
for as many people as possible.

If you've got a position where that's possible, and my skills sound relevant,
shoot me an email at ``alex.gaynor+lfw@gmail.com``.

About me
--------

* Comfortable programming in Python, Ruby, Java, C, C++, Javascript, SQL, Rust,
  Go, Classic ASP/VBScript. Some of these are a bit rusty, I've written more
  VBScript in the past year than C++.
* I've been involved in open source in nearly every possible capacity. I've
  built a high performance Ruby VM and open sourced it (`Topaz`_), helped to
  create and grow a cryptography library (`pyca/cryptography`_), contributed
  substantial features and refactorings to a web framework (`Django`_ core
  developer), co-chaired a conference program committee (`PyCon`_), and been a
  member of the Board of Directors for the Python Software Foundation.
* Advocated for and implemented improvements to the Python HTTPS/TLS stack,
  notably backporting significant improvements from Python 3 to Python 2 and
  enabling certificate validation by default.
* I'm comfortable with high stress/high ambiguity work. I've worked on projects
  while they were on the front page of newspapers and being investigated (e.g.
  the Office of Personnel Management post-compromise).
* Willing to work in, or learn, any technical stack necessary to get the job
  done (see the aforementioned Classic ASP).
* Participated in on-call rotation for production web applications.
* Led remediation of scores upon scores of vulnerabilities in decade old code.
* Debugged strange network protocols and found bugs in glibc.
* Interviewed O(100) engineering candidates.

In short, I've participated in just about every stage of the software
development process, in a variety of different environments.

About you
---------

**Note:** No single one of these is a deal breaker, but it goes without saying
that the more of these that describe you the better.

* You care about security, about protecting your users.
* You're working at large scale, in some way. Maybe it's a lot of users, maybe
  the data is particularly sensitive, maybe you have visibility into and are
  contributing to many different clients.
* You recognize that security teams only get so many "because I said so"s and
  you prioritize UX and practices which work in the real world.
* You care about building a diverse and inclusive workplace, and you put that
  caring into action.
* You're committed to being *really* good at what you do.
* You have an office in Washington, D.C., or support remote work. I'm willing
  to move for the right position, but being in D.C. is a big plus.
