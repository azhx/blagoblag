A year of tracking my ``http://`` requests
==========================================

For a year or so I've been running a `Chrome extension I wrote`_, which tracks
which origins my Chrome makes the most ``http://`` requests to, in an effort to
make my ``https://`` advocacy more data driven. Websites that top this list are
disrespectful of my privacy and show no regard for whether bytes make their way
to me unmodified.

Over the past year, I've seen several websites that used to top this list
migrate to ``https://``, for example Amazon, Netflix, and the Washington Post.
I commend them on making the migration and protecting my privacy!

Here are the current top 25 origins which receive the most ``http://``
requests, grouped by brand. If you work for one of these sites, offering HTTPS
should be a top priority. If you're not sure why, watch `this talk on MOAR
TLS`_ from earlier this year.

These sites represent the biggest opportunity to improve the percentage of
requests I make which are ``https://``, so I'm hopeful they will begin and
complete the migration in the coming months!
