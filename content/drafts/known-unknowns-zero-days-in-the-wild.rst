Known unknowns - zero days in the wild
======================================

This past week Google's Project Zero disclosed an `unfixed security issue in
Microsoft's Edge browser`_. This is not the first time Microsoft failed to
patch an issue within Project Zero's disclosure timeline. This produces strong
feelings in the information security community, generally in one of three
categories:

* praising Google's vulnerability research
* criticizing Microsoft's response
* criticizing Google for publicly disclosing the vulnerability before it was
  patched

The debate over what the correct vulnerability disclosure policy is is not a
new one. Oftentimes this debate focuses on how much risk is generated by
potentially giving new attackers access to this vulnerability vs. how well
defenders will be able to protect themselves given knowledge of the
vulnerability. But this ignores a third group: attackers who are already aware
of the vulnerability, and are actively exploiting it.

Read any online discussion over vulnerability disclosure policy and someone
will ask, "What is the urgency around this vulnerability, there's no evidence
of use in the wild?" I believe this is both a common sentiment, and one based
on a dangerous misunderstanding of vulnerability exploitation. It fundamentally
assumes that we have good visibility into what vulnerabilities are being
exploited.

We don't. While mass malware like WannaCry necessarily makes itself visible,
targeted ones like the Trident malware can go undetected for many years -- the
Trident malware was discovered attacking iOS 9, but disassembly showed that it
was designed to work at least as far back as iOS 7.

For sophisticated attackers, like national intelligence agencies, stealth is a
feature. They put as much effort into making sure their attacks are undetected
as they do into ensuring they work in the first place. As a result, they're
probably pretty good at it. In `RAND's "Zero Days, Thousands of Nights"`_
report they spoke with numerous exploit developers and, "None we spoke to
believed that their vulnerabilities or exploits died or were discovered due to
use by a customer in some operational campaign, or by information leakage". As
an industry we need to evolve our thinking beyond mass malware if we want to
protect users against sophisticated nation state attackers. We must adapt to
the idea that many governments have exploits that go from malicious website to
kernel code execution against every major browser/operating system, and that we
have no visibility into how they're used.

When we ocassionally do get insights into what exploitation looks like in the
real world, it generally confirms this perspective: vulnerabilities and
exploits can be used in the wild for long periods of time without detection. We
shouldn't assume that the same approaches that worked against mass malware will
be effective against targeted attackers.

We shouldn't design our approach to security based on the idea that we will
know when and how it is being exploited; so when we find out about bugs, we
should fix them promptly -- if anything, Project Zero's 90 day disclosure
timeline may be too long.
